### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was my first time doing some coding
    and learning how the class works. I could also write functions for
    the first time and made friends who helped me throughout the lab.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1, was another favorite because I finally knew how
    coding can be used in real-life situations. That was also the
    first time I learned that we could check if our formatting were
    correct, which was fantastic.
  
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was my favorite because I was always curious about
    how the game works and how it was developed. I could now know and
    understand how it works and code it. In general, it's an incredible
    and memorable lab.
